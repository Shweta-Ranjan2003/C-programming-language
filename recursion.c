/*Recursion is a process when a function calls a copy of itself to work on smaller problems.
Any function which calls itself is called recursive function.
A termination condition is imposed on such functions to stop them executing copies of themselves infinitely.
Any problem which can be solved recursively can also be solved iteratively.
eg. Hanoi, Fibonacci series, factorial finding etc.
The case at which the function doesnâ€™t recur is called the base case.
