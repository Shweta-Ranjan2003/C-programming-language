    And it is also known as subscript variable.
    Data in an array is stored in contiguous memory locations in RAM.
    It can also store the collection of derived data types such as pointers, structures etc.
    The C Language places no limits on the number of dimensions in an array.
     i.e. we can create any no. of dimension array E.g. 1d(vector) 2d array(matrice)etc.
    Index No. â€“ It is the special type of no. which allows us to access variables of Arrays.
